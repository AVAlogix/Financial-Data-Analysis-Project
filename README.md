## Project Overview
This project involves extracting and analyzing financial data from 10-K filings of major companies (Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple). The goal is to identify key financial trends and indicators, clean the data, and prepare it for further AI-based processing.

## Steps Involved

### Step 1: Data Extraction
#### Navigate to the SEC's EDGAR Database:
- [Microsoft 10-K Filings](#)
- [Tesla 10-K Filings](#)
- [Apple 10-K Filings](#)

#### Manual Extraction:
For each company, locate the 10-K filings for the last three fiscal years and extract the following financial figures:
- Total Revenue
- Net Income
- Total Assets
- Total Liabilities
- Cash Flow from Operating Activities

#### Organizing Data:
- Compile the extracted data into an Excel spreadsheet for structured analysis in Python.

### Step 2: Preparing Your Jupyter Notebook Environment
- Install necessary Python libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Load and clean the extracted data
- Perform Year-over-Year (YoY) percentage change analysis
- Generate line charts for each financial metric

## Key Features
- **Automated YoY Analysis**: Calculates percentage changes across multiple financial metrics.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates line charts to illustrate financial trends over time.
- **Company-Specific Summaries**: Provides insights into individual company performances.
